## H-0: STRESS Test 4: This is a very long rule that exceeds normal length expectations and contains a lot of text to test how the system handles extremely long strings that might potentially break field limits or cause database issues or markdown formatting problems when they are inserted into the heuristics table and appended to the domain markdown file. We want to ensure the system gracefully handles such edge cases without truncation or corruption of data.
