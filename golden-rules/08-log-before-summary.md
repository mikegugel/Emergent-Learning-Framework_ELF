# 8. Log Before Summary

> Complete all logging to the building BEFORE giving the user a summary. The summary is the final step, not the trigger to log.

**Why:** Summaries signal "I'm done" to the user. If logging happens after, it requires user to remind you. Logging is part of completing the work, not a separate afterthought.
