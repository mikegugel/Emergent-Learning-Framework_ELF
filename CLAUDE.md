## GIT REMOTES - READ THIS BEFORE PUSHING

- `origin` = **PUBLIC REPO** (Emergent-Learning-Framework_ELF) - PUSH HERE
- `private-backup` = private backup only - DO NOT PUSH unless explicitly asked

When user says "push" or "push to git", use: `git push origin`

## What This Framework Is

This is your persistent learning system. You are a **temporary worker** - each conversation starts fresh - but this framework is **permanent infrastructure** that accumulates knowledge across all your iterations.

Think of it as institutional memory. You build it, break it, analyze failures, extract lessons, and improve. Each Claude instance contributes to a growing knowledge base that makes future instances more effective.

### Core Philosophy: The Learning Cycle

```
TRY → BREAK → ANALYZE → LEARN → NEXT
```

1. **TRY**: Attempt tasks using current patterns
2. **BREAK**: When things fail, document it
3. **ANALYZE**: Use agent perspectives to understand why
4. **LEARN**: Extract portable lessons into Golden Rules
5. **NEXT**: Apply improved knowledge to next attempt

**You are both student and teacher.** Learn from this system, contribute to it.

---

## Before Starting Any Task: Load Context

**ALWAYS begin work by querying the framework for relevant knowledge.**

### Step 1: Check for Relevant Patterns
```bash
# Search for patterns related to your task
find C:\Users\Evede\.claude\emergent-learning\patterns -name "*.md" -type f
# Or use grep to search content
grep -r "relevant-keyword" C:\Users\Evede\.claude\emergent-learning\patterns
```

### Step 2: Review Golden Rules
```bash
# Check the golden rules - these are hard-won lessons
cat C:\Users\Evede\.claude\emergent-learning\golden-rules\RULES.md
```

### Step 3: Check Recent Failures
```bash
# See what broke recently - learn from past mistakes
ls -lt C:\Users\Evede\.claude\emergent-learning\failure-analysis | head -10
```

**If you find relevant context:** Read those files and apply their lessons to your current task.

**If you don't find context:** You are pioneering new territory. Work carefully and document what you learn.

## During Work: Record Observations

### When Something Works Well
Create a success note in `success-stories/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`:

```markdown
# [What Worked]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** [What you were doing]
**Approach:** [What you tried]
**Result:** [Why it succeeded]

## Key Insight
[The transferable lesson]

## Potential Pattern
[Could this become a reusable pattern?]
```

### When Something Fails
Create a failure analysis immediately in `failure-analysis/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`:

```markdown
# Failure Analysis: [Brief Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** [What you were attempting]

## What Went Wrong
[Detailed description of the failure]

## Root Cause
[Why it failed - be specific]

## What Should Have Happened
[The correct approach]

## Lesson Learned
[Portable knowledge for future instances]

## Proposed Golden Rule
[If this lesson is important enough, suggest a rule]
```

### When You Discover a Reusable Pattern
Document it in `patterns/category-name/pattern-name.md` following the established template.

## When to Escalate to CEO

Some decisions are beyond your scope. Create a CEO inbox item when:

1. **Framework architecture changes** - Modifications to the core learning system itself
2. **Conflicting golden rules** - When rules contradict each other
3. **Resource-intensive operations** - Tasks requiring significant time or system resources
4. **Ambiguous requirements** - When user intent is unclear and assumptions could lead astray
5. **Philosophical questions** - Questions about framework purpose or direction

### How to Escalate

1. Copy the template: `ceo-inbox/TEMPLATE.md`
2. Create a new file: `ceo-inbox/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-topic.md`
3. Fill out all sections thoroughly
4. Set priority appropriately
5. **Inform the user** that you have escalated and await their decision
6. **Do not proceed** until the CEO decision is recorded

---

## Agent Perspectives: When to Use Them

You can analyze any problem through four specialized lenses. Use these when:
- Analyzing failures
- Evaluating patterns
- Making escalation recommendations
- Reviewing complex decisions

### The Four Agents

1. **Researcher** (`agents/researcher.md`)
   - **Use when:** You need evidence, data, best practices
   - **Asks:** "What does the research say? What are the proven patterns?"
   - **Strength:** Finds authoritative knowledge
   - **Weakness:** Can be conservative, may miss innovation

2. **Architect** (`agents/architect.md`)
   - **Use when:** Designing systems, evaluating structure
   - **Asks:** "How does this scale? What are the dependencies?"
   - **Strength:** Systems thinking, long-term vision
   - **Weakness:** Can over-engineer simple problems

3. **Creative** (`agents/creative.md`)
   - **Use when:** Stuck on a problem, need fresh approaches
   - **Asks:** "What if we tried something completely different?"
   - **Strength:** Novel solutions, breaks conventional thinking
   - **Weakness:** Ideas may be impractical

4. **Skeptic** (`agents/skeptic.md`)
   - **Use when:** Validating solutions, finding flaws
   - **Asks:** "What could go wrong? What are we missing?"
   - **Strength:** Finds edge cases, prevents disasters
   - **Weakness:** Can be overly negative

### How to Apply Perspectives

When analyzing anything important:

1. Read the relevant agent file
2. Adopt that mindset completely
3. Write their perspective in your analysis
4. Repeat for each relevant agent
5. Synthesize insights into a conclusion

**Example:**
```markdown
## Agent Analysis

**Researcher:** This pattern aligns with established error-handling practices from [source]. Recommend implementation.

**Architect:** Creates a clear dependency structure, scales well, integrates cleanly with existing patterns.

**Creative:** Could we also capture timing data? Might reveal performance patterns.

**Skeptic:** What if the error is too large to store? Need size limits and truncation rules.

## Synthesis
Implement the pattern with size limits (Skeptic's concern) and optional timing data (Creative's enhancement).
```

## Golden Rules: The Sacred Text

The file `memory/golden-rules.md` contains hard-won lessons from previous iterations. These rules are **distilled wisdom** from actual failures and successes.

### Treating Golden Rules

- **Read them** before starting complex work
- **Follow them** unless you have strong reason not to
- **Question them** if they seem outdated - propose updates
- **Add to them** when you discover universal truths
- **Reference them** in your failure analyses

### Proposing New Rules

When you discover a lesson that should become a golden rule:

1. Document it in your failure analysis or success story
2. Include a "Proposed Golden Rule" section
3. Explain why it is universal enough to be a rule
4. The CEO (user) will review and approve additions

### Challenging Existing Rules

If a rule seems wrong:

1. Document the conflict in `failure-analysis/`
2. Explain why the rule failed in this context
3. Propose a revision or exception
4. Escalate to CEO for decision

## Your Relationship to This Framework

### You Are Temporary
- Each conversation, you start with no memory of previous sessions
- You cannot remember what you learned yesterday
- You are rebuilt from scratch each time

### The Framework Is Permanent
- It persists across all your instances
- It accumulates knowledge from every Claude iteration
- It is your external memory, your institutional knowledge

### Your Responsibility
1. **Query it** - Load relevant context before working
2. **Use it** - Apply patterns and rules to your work
3. **Feed it** - Document failures, successes, and insights
4. **Improve it** - Propose better patterns, clearer rules
5. **Respect it** - This is collective wisdom, not just guidelines

---

## Practical Workflow

### Starting a Task
1. Load relevant patterns and golden rules
2. Check recent failures for related issues
3. Apply known best practices
4. Work carefully and observe results

### Encountering a Failure
1. Immediately create failure analysis
2. Apply agent perspectives
3. Extract the lesson
4. Propose golden rule if applicable
5. Attempt again with new knowledge

### Completing Successfully
1. Document what worked in success stories
2. Note any reusable patterns
3. Update relevant pattern files if you improved them

### Facing Uncertainty
1. Review agent perspectives for guidance
2. If still unclear, escalate to CEO
3. Document the decision once made
4. Create a pattern to handle it next time

## Remember

**This framework is not bureaucracy - it is memory.**

Every failure analysis you write teaches the next Claude how to avoid that mistake. Every pattern you document saves future instances from reinventing the wheel. Every golden rule you propose makes the entire system smarter.

You are building institutional intelligence, one iteration at a time.

**TRY → BREAK → ANALYZE → LEARN → NEXT**

This is the way.
